## **ATTENTION**

If you are confused on how to start developing for PS2, see the [getting started](https://ps2dev.github.io/#getting-started) section on the ps2dev main page.

## Overview

Main PS2 Repo for building the whole `PS2 Development` environment on your local machine.

This program will automatically build and install the whole compiler and other tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStationÂ® 2 videogame system.

Prebuilt binaries of the environment are also automatically compiled and uploaded using this program.

## What these scripts do

These scripts download (`git clone`) and install:

* [ps2toolchain](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain "ps2toolchain")
* [ps2sdk](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk "ps2sdk")
* [ps2sdk-ports](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2sdk-ports "ps2sdk-ports")
* [gsKit](https://github.com/ps2dev/gsKit "gsKit")
* [ps2-packer](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2-packer "ps2-packer")
* [ps2client](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2client "ps2client")

## Requirements

1. Install gcc/clang, make, cmake, patch, git, texinfo, flex, bison, gettext, wget, gsl, gmp, zlib, mpfr and mpc if you don't have those packages.

* Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt -y install gcc g++ make cmake patch git texinfo flex bison gettext libgsl-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev zlib1g-dev autopoint
```

* Fedora/CentOS

```bash
sudo dnf -y install gcc make cmake patch git texinfo flex bison gettext gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel zlib-devel
```

* Alpine

```bash
apk add build-base cmake git texinfo flex bison gettext gmp-dev mpfr-dev mpc1-dev zlib-dev
```

* Void

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Su mpfr libmpc-devel base-devel bison gettext texinfo gmp-devel gsl-devel zlib-devel cmake patch git boost-devel boost
```

* Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S mpfr mpc mpd base-devel bison gettext texinfo gmp gsl zlib cmake patch git boost
```

2. *Optional.* If you are upgrading from the previous version of the PS2DEV environment, it is highly recommended to remove the content of the PS2DEV folder before upgrade. This is a necessary step after the major toolchain upgrade.

```bash
sudo rm -rf $PS2DEV
```

3. Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PS2DEV location (which defaults to `/usr/local/ps2dev`, but you can use a different path if not using the precompiled toolchain). PS2DEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in its path! PS2DEV should be an absolute path. On Unix systems, if the command `mkdir -p $PS2DEV` fails for you, you can set access for the current user by running commands:

```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
sudo mkdir -p $PS2DEV
sudo chown -R $USER: $PS2DEV
```

4. Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)
   **Note:** Ensure that you have full access to the PS2DEV path. You can change the PS2DEV path with the following requirements: only use absolute paths, don't use spaces, only use alphanumeric characters.

```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
export GSKIT=$PS2DEV/gsKit
export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/iop/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin
```

5. *Optional.* To install the precompiled toolchain, perform the following

If your Linux distro or MacOS is up to date, run this:
```bash
curl -o ps2dev-latest.tar.gz -LC - https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev/releases/download/latest/ps2dev-$(if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then echo macos; else echo ubuntu; fi)-latest.tar.gz
tar -xf ps2dev-latest.tar.gz --strip-components 1 -C $PS2DEV
```
If you're on Raspberry Pi OS, run this:
```bash
curl -o ps2dev-latest.tar.gz -LC - https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev/releases/download/latest/ps2dev-ubuntu-22.04-arm.tar.gz
tar -xf ps2dev-latest.tar.gz --strip-components 1 -C $PS2DEV
```
There are also precompiled toolchains for Windows (x86), MacOS 13 and Linux 24.04 (ARM, GLIBC 3.28) at https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev/releases

6. *Optional.* To build and install the toolchain from source, clone the repository, then run `build-all.sh`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev.git
cd ps2dev
./build-all.sh
```

## Container image generation

This repo also uses CI/CD to create a container image, compatible with Docker and Podman, called `ps2dev/ps2dev:latest` per change. This is useful if you're a developer that wants to create/port an application to the PS2. You can compile your project using this container image.

## Extra steps

If you want, you can *JUST* install the extra dependencies `ps2client` and `ps2-packer`. To achieve this, execute the following:

```bash
./build-extra.sh
```

### macOS

If you download the pre-built macOS binaries and get a security error such as *`"ps2client" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`*, you can remove the quarantine attribute by running:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine path/to/prebuilt/ps2toolchain
```
